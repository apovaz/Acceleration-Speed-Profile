Hi,

This is my first attempt to upload something on here.

I tried to construct the acceleration speed profile of a football player from 10Hz raw GPS data based on the following paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38206549/ (Miguens et al., 2024) 

Not the most efficient code, but it works!

I'd love to get your feedback.
